          Internetification of Vulnerable Communities - Leveraging Internet Magic for Climate and Development<br/>
          <em>by Tim Reutemann</em><br/><br/>
          In the course of a climate & development project targeting solar electrification, we are about to bring first-time internet access to remote communities on the islands of Vanuatu. As the islands are largely closed to international travel and remain COVID-Free, internet is a key element for the stakeholder consultations, grievance mechanisms and project monitoring. In this session, I will briefly present the local setup and want to discuss the hard- & software setup to ensure digital souvereignity and avoid the creation of path dependencies on malicious actors like Facebook or Wechat.

          Capitalism pushes waste and abuse in the worlds of hardware and software. We can hack back, breaking the Hardware-Software Industrial Complex, preparing for climate collapse, and making the tech we love available to everyone.

          Why activists should consider amateur radio communications<br/>
          <em>by Greggawatt</em><br/><br/>
          As the last year has shown us, infrastructure of many types can fail and one of those being communication infrastructure. Cell phones and the internet can often be unavailable either due to disaster or government interference and activists need to be comfortable with backup communication infrastructure. This talk will cover the basics of amateur or ham radio, how and why you should get a license, what you can do with a license and how amateur radio communications is an essential tool in the activist toolbelt.<br/><br/>
          Greggawatt is a ham radio operator and really wants you to get on the air. when he's not propagating signals he's trying to grow more sweet potatoes.

          It's All Connected</br>
          <em>by Cloudkicker</em><br/><br/>
          hacking seems to be ideologically connected to witchcraft, punk, hip hop. The same idea of “we help us” is even manifested in the game Destiny. The point isn’t to create this Christian juxtaposition of good against evil, but to point out an interesting connection, and to hopefully open eyes, dialogue, and doors.
